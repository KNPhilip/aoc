## Advent of Code
My solutions for the annual Christmas puzzles in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I am using [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) as my language of choice, which is a LISP dialect, descended from [MIT Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT/GNU_Scheme). To test the solutions I am utilizing [RackUnit](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/) for the sample cases of the puzzles.
